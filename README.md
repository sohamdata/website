## [og website](https://sohamdata.github.io/website/)


I made this website to teach myself and play around with:
- HTML, CSS
- Javascript (This was the first time I used JS, I've improved since and use this website as a playground to test random things on JS as this is a JS-heavy website)
- Adobe Illustrator Scripting using javascript.
- web hosting
- *markdown* 
- learnt a lot of things by playing around with the website and googling stuff.

#### Resources for Scripting in Adobe Illustrator:
